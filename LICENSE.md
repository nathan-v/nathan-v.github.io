# Licensing
All code, snippets, gists, and similar posted by Nathan V (https://github.com/nathan-v/) is MIT licensed unless otherwise specified.

#### Why MIT?
I love freedom. Don't you? GPL and it's variations are fine but today I prefer the _more_ open MIT license instead of other viral licensing options. Free software that is really free-as-in-freedom.
